        	<p class="reviews-body">The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a glorious screen, tonnes of power, a great camera and a beautiful design. It's waterproof too, so it wonn't conk out when you drop it in the bath.</p>

        	<p class="reviews-title"><b>The Bad</b></p>
        	<p class="reviews-body">It's expensive, it's regular autofocus adjustments during shotting can spoil videos, and the camera resolution is throttled when using the full automatic mode.</p>

        	<p class="reviews-title"><b>The Bottom Line</b></p>
        	<p class="reviews-body">Sure, it costs a bundle, but the Sony Xperia Z2 is everything you should expect from a top-end phone. If you're looking for both style and substance from a phone, you've come to the right place.</p>
